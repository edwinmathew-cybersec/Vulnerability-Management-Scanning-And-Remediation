# Vulnerability Management: Scanning And Remediation

## Objective

The objective of this lab was to create a controlled environment where I could simulate and detect cyber attacks. For this, two instances of virtual machines were created and used as host and target machines. The logs generated were ingested and analyzed using a SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) tool, providing telemetry that simulated real-world cyberattack scenarios. This hands-on lab allowed me to have a deep understanding of attack patterns, defensive methods and overall network security.

## Skills Learned

- Understanding of SIEM and it's practical application.
- Analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.
