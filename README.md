# Vulnerability Management: Scanning And Remediation


## Objective

The objective of this lab was to create an environment where I could scan the machines in my network for vulnerabilities. For this, an instance of a Windows 10 virtual machine was created as the target machine, and the Nessus Essentials vulnerability scanner was installed on the host. Network scans were performed on the vulnerable target machine from the host, simulating a real-world scenario. This hands-on lab gave me a deep understanding of vulnerabilities, scanning methods, and network security.

## Skills Learned

- Understanding of Vulnerability Scanner and its practical application.
- Analyzing and interpreting the information generated.
- Knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.


## Tools Used

- Nessus Essentials - A vulnerability assessment solution that includes remote and local (authenticated) security checks.
- Microsoft Excel - A spreadsheet program that is used to save and analyze numerical data.
- VirtualBox - Software that provides isolated environments for development and experimentation.
