# Vulnerability Management: Scanning And Remediation  


## Objective

The objective of this lab was to establish an environment conducive to scanning machines within a network for vulnerabilities. A dedicated Windows 10 virtual machine instance was deployed as the target system, while the host machine hosted the Nessus Essentials vulnerability scanner. Network scans were conducted on the susceptible target machine from the host, mimicking real-world scenarios. Through this practical exercise, I gained significant insights into vulnerabilities, scanning techniques, and network security protocols.

## Skills Learned

- Proficiency in using Nessus Essentials for vulnerability scanning, including optimizing scan parameters.
- Analytical skills to interpret scan results and prioritize vulnerabilities by severity.
- Understanding of network protocols and their associated vulnerabilities.
- Awareness of compliance requirements for vulnerability management.
- Ability to document and report findings effectively.


## Tools Used

- 𝗡𝗲𝘀𝘀𝘂𝘀 𝗘𝘀𝘀𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗮𝗹𝘀 - A vulnerability assessment solution that includes remote and local (authenticated) security checks.
- 𝗠𝗶𝗰𝗿𝗼𝘀𝗼𝗳𝘁 𝗘𝘅𝗰𝗲𝗹 - A spreadsheet program that is used to save and analyze numerical data.
- 𝗩𝗶𝗿𝘁𝘂𝗮𝗹𝗕𝗼𝘅 - Software that provides isolated environments for development and experimentation.
